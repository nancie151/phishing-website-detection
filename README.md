# phishing-website-detection
For most instances, URL phishing involves the use of emails to redirect recipients to malicious websites. The attackers' goal is to deceive users to disclose sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details. These websites can be very deceptive as they are skillfully designed to appear familiar and legitimate, their entire goal is to gain users’ trust and “fishing” for their personal information for malicious purposes. The impact of phishing attacks is significant, with businesses in the United States losing up to $2 billion per year as their clients fall victim to these attacks (citation: Gunter Ollmann, “The Phishing Guide Understanding & Preventing Phishing Attacks”, IBMInternet Security Systems, 2007)

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting phishing website by extracting Uniform Resource Locator (URL) features. A diverse dataset containing labeled samples of phishing URLs and legitimate URLs will be collected and used to train the model. By analyzing and extracting URL features and patterns, the model will be trained to accurately identify and classified phishing websites.
